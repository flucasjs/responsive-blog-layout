                    My name is John and living the simple life saved my life
                </h2>
                <p>
                    <strong>I used to be a pack rat</strong>. I had so many 
                    things that I thought that I loved, but the truth was I 
                    couldn't even appreciate any of it because there was too 
                    much.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Things were terrible. I had a job that I hated, a home that 
                    I didn't want to live in, and I couldn't hold a 
                    relationship.
                </p>
                <h3>
                    How I turned things around
                </h3>
                <p>
                    <strong>I was on the verge of a breakdown when I got rid of 
                    everything</strong>. I literally put 90% of my possessions 
                    in the garbage, sold my place and moved into a smaller 
                    apartment, and I quit my job.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It wasn't easy at all, but everything around me was in such 
                    a bad place, I didn't know what else to do. And it worked.
                </p>
                <h3>
                    Now I live the simple life
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Now that I'm living a simple life, things are so much 
                    better. I'm less stressed, enjoy life and work more, 
                    and I have more free time to enjoy.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With how much it turned my life around, <strong>I felt like 
                    I had no choice but to start sharing how I did it</strong>, 
                    and how others can benefit from living a simple life as 
                    well, which is why I started this site!
